# Hamlet
## Interpretation
It's Shakespears most famous play
Hamlet represents a man thorn by doubt
This man who is unable to get revenge for his father, thinks too much
It was interpreted as a tragedy of revenge or a tragedy of will (or better of lack of will)
Thought and doubt kills action
Hamlet can also be saw as a representation of Edipus Complex, where the son is in love with the mother and feels profound hatred towards the father
## The story
Hamlet was a danish prince lived between
The father of Hamlet, the king, has been murdered. After that Hamlet's mother marries his uncle Claudius.
At night Hamlet had a revelation, where he meets with his father's ghost that reveals him that Claudius is the murdered of his father, the ghost persuades him to take revenge.
So Hamlet should kill Claudius, but he has no shred of evidence, so he want to take time and observe; so he pretends he was becoming insane.
He want to be sure to kill the right person
He **was not a hero**, he asks some actors to do a performance where they show the act of the murder, Claudius killing Hamlet's father, to see the reaction of the royals. Claudius feels astonished watching the play, so Hamlet knows that Claudius is the murderer
Hamlet is in love with Ophelia (daughter of the king' councelor Polonius), **by accident Hamlet kills Polonius**. Ophelia as a consequence becomes mad and commits suicide.
Laerthes, brother of Ophelia, wants to kill Hamlet due to this and is supported by Claudius (that knew he has been recognized as the murdere). During the duel Larthus carries a poisonous weapon and thanks to this kills Hamlet, but not before he has stabbed to death the king and wounded deadly Laerthes.

## To be or not to be
#### Setting
Polonius and the king are peeking in the room to see how Hamlet behaves, because he's going insane or he seems to be. Ophelia is also in the room, but he doesn't realize until the very last and once he realizes he lowers the pitch abruptly.
It's a monologue.
#### Trama
The matter is wheter to accept the fate or to fight it and commit suicide.
In the death's sleep the dreams that could come stop us from commiting suicide, then there is our respect toward who bears
- the despise
- the injustice
- the refused love
- the slow law suits (people that aren't punished)

He enumerates all the human suffering. Death is the undiscovered country from whose limits nobody came back.
Our thoughts lead us to doubts and fear of death, mislead us and make us fail in our resolution.
